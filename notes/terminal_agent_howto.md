1. **Training Data**: Ensure that the AI model is trained on data that includes terminal operations. T
his will help it understand and perform actions at the end of a sequence.                             
                                                                                                      
2. **Contextual Understanding**: The AI needs to have a good understanding of contextual information, 
such as the state of the environment or the user's intent. This understanding helps in making decision
s about how to behave when faced with terminal operations.                                            
                                                                                                      
3. **Planning and Action Generation**: The AI should be capable of planning actions before execution a
nd generating them based on that plan. This involves decomposing complex tasks into smaller, manageabl
e parts.                                                                                              

4. **Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback loop where the AI can learn from its actions and improve ov
er time. This helps in understanding what works well and what needs adjustment.

5. **Environmental Flexibility**: The AI should be able to adapt and handle different terminal scenari
os within the same contextual environment. This involves having the ability to make decisions based on
 the current state of the system and any external factors that might affect it.

6. **User Interface**: If the AI is interacting with a graphical user interface (GUI), the AI needs to
 be able to interpret and respond appropriately at the terminal level, which may involve understanding
 visual cues or other forms of input presented by the GUI.
